// This HLSL function returns a float 0 to 1, It is basicly a very slow ping-pong but it keeps the numbers close to 0 or 1 with a nice curve in between
float SnappyTimeBasedToggle()

		//Function by TWKTemplar
		float a = 0.5f;//Default 0.5,Distance between toggles a=1 makes a 5 second distance, a=0.5 makes a 10 second distance
		float b = 6;//Default 6, Length of time of the return number being 1, b=1 means 4 seconds,b=5.5f, means 2 seconds, Keep as an int if you dont want an error
		float SinWaveMask = ceil(sin(a*_Time.y)*0.9f);
		float BouncingSinWave = pow(sin(a * _Time.y), b);
		float d = 10;//Default 10, sclaed amount, 10 for lots of clamping, 1 for a smooth curve, keep above 1
		float ScaledAndClamped = saturate((((SinWaveMask * BouncingSinWave) + 1) * d) - d);
